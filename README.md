# mlr3book

[![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/mlr-org/mlr3book.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mlr-org/mlr3book)

Package to build the mlr3 [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) book.
The rendered book can be found [here](https://mlr-org.github.io/mlr3book/).

To install all necessary dependencies for the book, install this package using [remotes](https://cran.r-project.org/package=remotes):

```r
remotes::install_github("mlr-org/mlr3book", dependencies = TRUE)
```

To build the book, run the following R command in the repository root:

```r
pkgload::load_all()
serve_mlr3book()
```

This starts a service which automatically (re-)compiles the bookdown sources in the background.
Alternatively, you can run `./serve` if you have `Rscript` in your `PATH`.
If your browser does not open automatically, go to http://127.0.0.1:4321/.

## File system structure

The root directory is a regular R package.
The book is in the subdirectory "bookdown".

## Style Guide

### Links and References

The package `mlr3book` provides the helpers `cran_pkg()`, `mlr_pkg()`, `gh_pkg()`, and `ref()`
Example:

```
See the manual for `r ref("Experiment")`.
More learners can be found in `r mlr_pkg("mlr_learners")`.
We heavily use `r cran_pkg("data.table")` internally.
You need the development version of `r gh_pkg("mlr-org/mlr3")` for this.
```

### Chunk Names

Chunks are named automatically as `[chapter-name]-#` by calling `name_chunks_mlr3book()`:

```r
mlr3book::name_chunks_mlr3book()
```

### Blocks

You can add certain ["blocks"](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/custom-blocks.html) supported by [bookdown](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) for notes, warnings, etc.
Start the code chunk with `block` instead of `r` and add `type='caution'`.

````
```{block <name>, type='caution'}
<text>
```
````

### Spacing

- Always start a new sentence on a new line.
- Always start a new sentence on a new line.
- Put an empty line before and after code blocks.

### PDF version

If you use RStudio, you can click on "Build Website" in the "Build pane" of RStudio to build both the HTML and the PDF version.
Settings will be taken from `bookdown/_output.yml`.

To format code in the PDF nicely, please install _formatR_ via `pak::pkg_install("pablo14/formatR")`.

To build the PDF manually, call 

```r
rmarkdown::render_site("bookdown/", 
  output_format = bookdown::pdf_book(includes = list("bookdown/preamble.tex"),
    toc_depth = 4, highlight = "haddock", latex_engine = "xelatex", 
    citation_package = "natbib"))
```

(this call does sometimes not work. It is recommended to use RStudio.)
