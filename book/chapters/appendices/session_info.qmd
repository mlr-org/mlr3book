# Session Info {#sec-session-info}

{{< include ../../common/_setup.qmd >}}

If you would like to reproduce the results in this book, note that we run `set.seed(123)` at the start of all chapters, the `sessionInfo` at the time of publication is below, and the `r ref_pkg("renv")` lockfile at the time of publication can be found at `r link("https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3book/blob/main/book/renv.lock")`.
We cannot guarantee reproducibility across operating systems due to underlying implementations of the model's used.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
sessionInfo()
