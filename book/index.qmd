We appreciate all contributions, whether they are bug reports, feature requests, or pull requests that fix bugs or extend functionality.
Each of our GitHub repositories includes issues and pull request templates to ensure we can help you as much as possible to get started.
Please make sure you read our [code of conduct](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3/blob/main/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening your first issue or pull request.

With so many packages in our universe it may be hard to keep track of where to open issues, as a general rule:

1. If you have a question about using any part of the `mlr3` ecosystem, ask on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and use the tag #mlr3 -- one of our team will answer you there.
Be sure to include a reproducible example ([reprex](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example)) and if we think you found a bug then we will either refer you to the relevant GitHub repository or we will open an issue for you.
1. Issues or pull requests about core functionality (train, predict, etc.) should be opened in the [mlr3](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3) GitHub repository.
2. Issues or pull requests about learners should be opened in the [mlr3extralearners](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3extralearners) GitHub repository.
3. Issues or pull requests about measures should be opened in the [mlr3measures](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3measures) GitHub repository.
4. Issues or pull requests about specialized functionality (e.g., pipelines and tuning) should be opened in the GitHub repository of the respective package.

Do not worry about opening an issue in the wrong place, we will transfer it to the right one.

## Overview

The `mlr3` ecosystem is the result of many years of methodological and applied research.
This book describes the resulting features and discusses best practices for ML, technical implementation details, and in-depth considerations for model optimization.
This book may be helpful for both practitioners who want to quickly apply machine learning (ML) algorithms and researchers who want to implement, benchmark, and compare their new methods in a structured environment.
While we hope this book is accessible to a wide range of readers and levels of ML expertise, we do assume that readers have taken at least an introductory ML course or have the equivalent expertise and some basic experience with R.
A background in computer science or statistics is beneficial for understanding the advanced functionality described in the later chapters of this book, but not required.
A comprehensive ML introduction for those new to the field can be found in @james_introduction_2014.
@Wickham2017R provides a comprehensive introduction to data science in R.

The book is split into the following four parts:

**Part I: Fundamentals**<br>
In this part of the book we will teach you the fundamentals of `mlr3`.
This will give you a flavor of the building blocks of the `mlr3` universe and the basic tools you will need to tackle most machine learning problems.
We recommend that all readers study these chapters to become familiar with `mlr3` terminology, syntax, and style.
In @sec-basics we will cover the basic classes in `r mlr3`, including `Learner` (machine learning implementations), `Measure` (performance metrics), and `Task` (machine learning task definitions).
@sec-performance will take evaluation a step further to include discussions about resampling -- robust strategies for measuring model performance -- and benchmarking -- experiments for comparing multiple models.

**Part II: Tuning and Feature Selection**<br>
In this part of the book, we will look at more advanced methodology that is essential to developing powerful ML models with good predictive ability.
@sec-optimization introduces hyperparameter optimization, which is the process of tuning model hyperparameters to obtain better model performance.
Tuning is implemented via the `r mlr3tuning` package, which also includes methods for automating complex tuning processes, including nested resampling.
The performance of ML models can be improved by tuning hyperparameters but also by carefully selecting features.
@sec-feature-selection introduces feature selection with filters and wrappers implemented in `r mlr3filters` and `r mlr3fselect`.
For readers interested in taking a deep dive into tuning, @sec-optimization-advanced discusses advanced tuning methods including error handling, multi-objective tuning, and tuning with Hyperband and Bayesian optimization methods.

**Part III: Pipelines and Preprocessing**<br>
In Part III we introduce `r mlr3pipelines`, which allows users to implement complex ML workflows easily.
In @sec-pipelines we will show you how to build a pipeline out of discrete configurable operations and how to treat complex pipelines as if they were any other machine learning model.
In @sec-pipelines-nonseq we will build on the previous chapter by introducing non-sequential pipelines, which can have multiple branches that carry out operations concurrently.
We will also demonstrate how to tune pipelines, including how to tune which operations should be included in the pipeline.
Finally, in @sec-preprocessing we will put pipelines into practice by demonstrating how to solve common problems that occur when fitting ML models to messy data.

**Part IV: Advanced Topics**<br>
In the final part of the book, we will look at advanced methodology and technical details.
This part of the book is more theory-heavy in some sections to help ground the design and implementation decisions.
We will begin by looking at advanced technical details in @sec-technical that are essential reading for advanced users who require parallelization, custom error handling, or large databases.
@sec-large-benchmarking will build on all preceding chapters to introduce large-scale benchmarking experiments that compare many models, tasks, and measures; including how to make use of `mlr3` extension packages for loading data, using high-performance computing clusters, and formal statistical analysis of benchmark experiments.
@sec-interpretation will discuss different packages that are compatible with `mlr3` to provide model-agnostic interpretability for feature importance and local explainability of individual predictions.
@sec-special will then delve into detail on domain-specific methods that are implemented in our extension packages including survival analysis, density estimation, spatio-temporal analysis, and more.
Readers may choose to selectively read sections in this chapter depending on your use case (i.e., if you have domain-specific problems to tackle), or to use these as introductions to new domains to explore.
Finally, @sec-fairness will introduce algorithmic fairness, which includes specialized measures and methods to identify and reduce algorithmic biases.

\chapter*{Preface}

The \href{https://cran.r-project.org/package=mlr}{\texttt{mlr}}\index{\texttt{mlr}} package [@mlr] was first released on CRAN in 2013, with the core design and architecture dating back further.
Over time, the addition of many features led to a complex design that made it too difficult for us to extend further.
In hindsight, we saw that some design and architecture choices in \href{https://cran.r-project.org/package=mlr}{\texttt{mlr}}\index{\texttt{mlr}} made it difficult to support new features, in particular with respect to ML pipelines.
So in 2018, we set about working on a reimplementation, which resulted in the first release of \href{https://mlr3.mlr-org.com}{\texttt{mlr3}}\index{\texttt{mlr3}} on CRAN in July 2019.
