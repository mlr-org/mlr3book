Welcome to the **M**achine **L**earning in **R** universe. This is the online version of the upcoming book *Flexible and Robust Machine Learning Using mlr3 in R*. This book will teach you about the mlr3 universe of packages, from some machine learning methodology to implementations of complex algorithmic pipelines. We will cover how to use the mlr3 family of packages for data processing, fitting and training of machine learning models, tuning and hyperparameter optimization, feature selection, pipelines, data preprocessing, and model interpretability. In addition we will look at how our interface works beyond classification and regression settings to other fields including survival analysis, clustering, and more. Finally we will demonstrate how you can contribute to our universe by creating packages, learners, measures, pipelines, and other features.

We hope you enjoy reading our book and always welcome comments and feedback. If you notice any mistakes in the book we would appreciate if you could open an issue in the [mlr3book issue tracker](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3book/issues).
