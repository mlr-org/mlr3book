# Multilabel Classification {#multilabel}

```{r 08-special-multilabel-001, include = F}
library(mlr3)
library(mlr3book)
```

Multilabel classification deals with objects that can belong to more than one category at the same time.

The development has not started yet, we are looking for contributes.
Open an issue in `r mlr3book::gh_pkg("mlr-org/mlr3multioutput")` if you are interested!
