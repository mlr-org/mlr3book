# Performance Evaluation and Comparison {#perf-eval-cmp}

```{r 03-perf-001, include = F}
library(mlr3)
library(mlr3book)
```

Now that we are familiar with the basics of how to create tasks and learners, how to fit models, and do some basic performance evaluation, let's have a look at some of the details, and in particular how `r mlr3book::mlr_pkg("mlr3")` makes it easy to perform many common machine learning steps.

We will cover the following topics:

## Binary classification and ROC curves

[Binary classification](#binary-classification) is a special case of classification where the target variable to predict has only two possible values.
In this case, additional considerations apply; in particular [ROC curves](#binary-roc) and the threshold of where to predict one class versus the other.

## Resampling {#sec-perf-resampling}

[Resampling](#resampling) is a methodology to create training and test splits.
We cover how to

* access and select [resampling strategies](#resampling-settings),
* instantiate the [split into training and test sets](#resampling-inst) by applying the resampling, and
* execute the resampling to obtain [results](#resampling-exec).

Additional information on resampling can be found in the section about [nested resampling](#nested-resampling) and in the chapter on [model optimization](#optimization).

## Benchmarking {#sec-perf-benchmarking}

[Benchmarking](#benchmarking) is used to compare the performance of different models, for example models trained with different learners, on different tasks, or with different resampling methods.
This is usually done to get an overview of how different methods perform across different tasks.
We cover how to

* create a [benchmarking design](#bm-design),
* [execute a design](#bm-exec) and aggregate results, and
* [convert benchmarking objects](#bm-resamp) to other types of objects that can be used for different purposes.
