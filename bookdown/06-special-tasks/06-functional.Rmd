Functional data is data containing an ordering on the dimensions.
This implies that functional data consists of curves varying over a continuum, such as time, frequency, or wavelength.

There are two ways to model functional data:

* Modification of the learner, so that the learner is suitable for the functional data
* Modification of the task, so that the task matches the standard- or classification-learner
