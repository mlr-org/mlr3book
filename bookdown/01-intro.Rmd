# Introduction and Overview {#introduction}

The `r mlr_pkg("mlr3")` [@mlr3] package and [ecosystem](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3/wiki/Extension-Packages) provide a generic, object-oriented, and extensible framework for [classification](#tasks), [regression](#tasks), [survival analysis](#survival), and other machine learning tasks for the R language [@R].
We do not implement any [learners](#learners) ourselves, but provide a unified interface to many existing learners in R.
This unified interface provides functionality to extend and combine existing [learners](#learners), intelligently select and tune the most appropriate technique for a [task](#tasks), and perform large-scale comparisons that enable meta-learning.
Examples of this advanced functionality include [hyperparameter tuning](#tuning) and [feature selection](#fs). [Parallelization](#parallelization) of many operations is natively supported.

**Target Audience**

We expect that users of `r mlr_pkg("mlr3")` have at least basic knowledge of machine learning and R.
The later chapters of this book describe advanced functionality that requires more advanced knowledge of both.
`r mlr_pkg("mlr3")` is suitable for complex projects that use advanced functionality as well as one-liners to quickly prototype specific tasks.

`r mlr_pkg("mlr3")` provides a domain-specific language for machine learning in R.
We target both **practitioners** who want to quickly apply machine learning algorithms and **researchers** who want to implement, benchmark, and compare their new methods in a structured environment.
The package is a complete rewrite of an earlier version of `r mlr_pkg("mlr")` that leverages many years of experience to provide a state-of-the-art system that is easy to use and extend.

**Why a Rewrite?**

`r mlr_pkg("mlr")` [@mlr] was first released to [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) in 2013, with the core design and architecture dating back much further.
Over time, the addition of many features has led to a considerably more complex design that made it harder to build, maintain, and extend than we had hoped for.
With hindsight, we saw that some design and architecture choices in `r mlr_pkg("mlr")` made it difficult to support new features, in particular with respect to pipelines.
Furthermore, the R ecosystem as well as helpful packages such as `r cran_pkg("data.table")` have undergone major changes in the meantime.
It would have been nearly impossible to integrate all of these changes into the original design of `r mlr_pkg("mlr")`.
Instead, we decided to start working on a reimplementation in 2018, which resulted in the first release of `r mlr_pkg("mlr3")` on CRAN in July 2019.
The new design and the integration of further and newly-developed R packages (especially `r cran_pkg("R6")`, `r cran_pkg("future")`, and `r cran_pkg("data.table")`) makes `r mlr_pkg("mlr3")` much easier to use, maintain, and more efficient compared to its predecessor `r mlr_pkg("mlr")`.

**Design Principles**

We follow these general design principles in the `r mlr_pkg("mlr3")` package and ecosystem.

* Backend over frontend.
  Most packages of the `r mlr_pkg("mlr3")` ecosystem focus on processing and transforming data, applying machine learning algorithms, and computing results.
  We do not provide graphical user interfaces (GUIs); visualizations of data and results are provided in extra packages.
* Embrace `r cran_pkg("R6")` for a clean, object-oriented design, object state-changes, and reference semantics.
* Embrace `r cran_pkg("data.table")` for fast and convenient data frame computations.
* Unify container and result classes as much as possible and provide result data in `data.table`s.
    This considerably simplifies the API and allows easy selection and "split-apply-combine" (aggregation) operations.
    We combine `data.table` and `R6` to place references to non-atomic and compound objects in tables and make heavy use of list columns.
* Defensive programming and type safety.
  All user input is checked with [`checkmate`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=checkmate) [@checkmate].
  Return types are documented, and mechanisms popular in base R which "simplify" the result unpredictably (e.g., `sapply()` or the `drop` argument in `[.data.frame`) are avoided.
* Be light on dependencies.
  One of the main maintenance burdens for `r mlr_pkg("mlr")` was to keep up with changing learner interfaces and behavior of the many packages it depended on.
  We require far fewer packages in `r mlr_pkg("mlr3")` to make installation and maintenance easier.

**Package Ecosystem**

`r mlr_pkg("mlr3")` builds upon the following packages not developed by core members of the `r mlr_pkg("mlr3")` team:

  * `r cran_pkg("R6")`:
    Reference class objects.
  * `r cran_pkg("data.table")`:
    Extension of R's `data.frame`.
  * `r cran_pkg("digest")`:
    Hash digests.
  * `r cran_pkg("uuid")`:
    Unique string identifiers.
  * `r cran_pkg("lgr")`:
    Logging facility.
  * `r cran_pkg("mlbench")`:
    A collection of machine learning data sets.

All these packages are well curated and mature; we expect no problems with dependencies.
Additionally, we suggest the following packages for extra functionality:

* For [parallelization](#parallelization): `r cran_pkg("future")` / `r cran_pkg("future.apply")`.
* For [progress bars](#progress-bars): `r cran_pkg("progressr")`.
* For [capturing output, warnings, and exceptions](#error-handling): `r cran_pkg("evaluate")` or `r cran_pkg("callr")`.

The `r mlr_pkg("mlr3")` package itself provides the base functionality that the rest of ecosystem rely on and some of the fundamental building blocks for machine learning.
The following packages extend `r mlr_pkg("mlr3")` with capabilities for preprocessing, pipelining, visualizations, additional learners, additional task types, and more:

```{r 01-intro-001, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="98%", eval=knitr::is_html_output()}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mlr-org/mlr3/master/man/figures/mlr3verse.svg")
```

```{asis 01-intro-001a, include=knitr::is_latex_output(), results='asis'}
