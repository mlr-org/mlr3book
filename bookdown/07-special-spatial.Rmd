## Spatial Analysis {#spatial}

Spatial data observations entail reference information about spatial characteristics.
This information is frequently stored as coordinates named 'x' and 'y'.
Treating spatial data using non-spatial data methods could lead to over-optimistic treatment.
This is due to the underlying auto-correlation in spatial data.

See `r gh_pkg("mlr-org/mlr3spatiotemporal")` for the current state of the implementation.
