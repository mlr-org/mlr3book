# Introduction and Overview

The `mlr3` package and ecosystem provides a generic, object-oriented, and extensible framework for classification, regression, survival analysis and other ML tasks for the R language.
It provides a unified interface to many basic learners and includes meta-algorithms and model selection techniques to improve and extend the functionality of basic learners with, e.g., hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, and ensemble construction.
Parallel high-performance computing is natively supported.
`mlr`'s ambition is to create a domain-specific language for machine learning in R.
The package targets practitioners who want to quickly apply machine learning algorithms, as well as researchers who want to implement, benchmark, and compare their new methods in a structured environment.

**Why a Rewrite?**

`mlr` was first released to CRAN in 2013. Its core design and architecture date back much further further.
The addition of many features has led to considerable feature creep which made `mlr`-version-2 harder to maintain and harder to extend than we had hoped for.
Many helpful R libraries enabling better design did not exist at the time `mlr` was created, and their inclusion results in non-trivial API changes, and we certainly made some less than optimal design choices of our own in `mlr`-v2, especially regarding the pipelining / wrapper system.
Around 2018 we decided it was time for housecleaning and a fresh reboot, and in 2019 we released the initial version of `mlr3` to CRAN.


**Design Principles**

* Most `mlr3` package focus on computation. Visualization is often in other packages, and we do not provide GUIs.
* Embrace [R6](https://cran.r-project.org/package=R6), clean OO-design, object state-changes and reference semantics. This might be less "traditional R", but seems to fit `mlr` nicely.
* Embrace [`data.table`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=data.table) for fast and convenient data frame computations.
* Unify container / results classes as much as possible and arrange result data in data.tables. This considerably simplifies our API and allows natural selection and aggregation operations. We also combine `data.table` and `R6` to place references to non-atomic / compound objects in tables and make heavy use of list columns in data.tables.
* Be light on dependencies. Dependencies can break workflows if they change, slow down and complicate installation and introduce considerable complexity. `mlr3` requires the following packages:
    - [`backports`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=backports): Ensures backward compatibility with older R releases. Developed by members of the `mlr` team. No recursive dependencies.
    - [`checkmate`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=checkmate): Fast argument checks. Developed by members of the `mlr` team. No extra recursive dependencies.
    - [`mlr3misc`](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3misc) Miscellaneous functions used in multiple `mlr3` [extension packages](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3/wiki/Extension-Packages). Developed by the `mlr` team. No extra recursive dependencies.
    - [`paradox`](https://github.com/mlr-org/paradox): Descriptions for parameters and parameter sets. Developed by the `mlr` team. No extra recursive dependencies.
    - [`R6`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=R6): Reference class objects. No recursive dependencies.
    - [`data.table`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=data.table): Extension of R's `data.frame`. No recursive dependencies.
    - [`digest`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=digest): Hash digests. No recursive dependencies.
    - [`lgr`](https://github.com/s-fleck/lgr): Logging facility. No extra recursive dependencies.
    - [`Metrics`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=Metrics): Package which implements performance measures. No recursive dependencies.
    - [`mlbench`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=mlbench): A collection of machine learning data sets. No dependencies.

* Additional functionality that comes with extra dependencies:
    - For parallelization, `mlr3` utilizes the [`future`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=future) and [`future.apply`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=future.apply) packages.
    - To capture output, warnings and exceptions, [`evaluate`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=evaluate) and [`callr`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=callr) can be used.


**Target Audience**

`mlr3` aims at users who have at least had minimum amount of exposure to ML and are at least somewhat fluent in R. It strives to be a powerful domain-specific language and workhorse for ML, instead of providing limited oneliner solutions for REPL. It is meant for programming, extension and expressive workflows.While we try to make important operations as convenient as possible and try to be precise and helpful in our documentation, we will not hide certain technical underpinnings of the system from the user, e.g., our usage of R6, data.table and futures, and we expect users to familiarize themselves with these (great) packages.
