# Introduction and Overview

The `r mlr_pkg("mlr3")` package and ecosystem provides a generic, object-oriented, and extensible framework for classification, regression, survival analysis and other ML tasks for the R language.
It provides a unified interface to many basic learners and includes meta-algorithms and model selection techniques to improve and extend the functionality of basic learners.
Examples include hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, and ensemble construction.
Parallelization is natively supported.

Our ambition is to create a domain-specific language for machine learning in R.
This project targets **practitioners** who want to quickly apply machine learning algorithms and **researchers** who want to implement, benchmark, and compare their new methods in a structured environment.

**Why a Rewrite?**

`r mlr_pkg("mlr")` was first released to CRAN in 2013. 
The core design and architecture date back much further.
The addition of many features has led to considerable feature creep which made `r mlr_pkg("mlr")` v2 harder to maintain and extend than we had hoped for.

Many helpful R packages did not exist at the time `r mlr_pkg("mlr")` was created, and their inclusion results in non-trivial API changes
In `r mlr_pkg("mlr")` we certainly made some suboptimal design choices, especially regarding the pipelining / wrapper system.
In 2018 we decided it was time for housecleaning and a fresh reboot
In July 2019 we released the initial version of `r mlr_pkg("mlr3")` to CRAN.

**Design Principles**

* Most packages of the `r mlr_pkg("mlr3")` framework focus on computation. 
    Visualization is outsourced to other packages and we do not provide GUIs.
* Embrace [R6](https://cran.r-project.org/package=R6), clean OO-design, object state-changes and reference semantics. 
    This might be less "traditional R", but seems to fit `r mlr_pkg("mlr")` nicely.
* Embrace [`data.table`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=data.table) for fast and convenient data frame computations.
* Unify container / results classes as much as possible and arrange result data in data.tables. 
    This considerably simplifies the API and allows natural selection and aggregation operations. 
    We combine `data.table` and `R6` to place references to non-atomic / compound objects in tables and make heavy use of list columns.
* Be light on dependencies. 
    Dependencies can break workflows if they change, slow down and complicate installation and introduce considerable complexity.

Additional functionality that comes with extra dependencies:

- For parallelization, `r mlr_pkg("mlr3")` utilizes the [`future`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=future) and [`future.apply`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=future.apply) packages.
- To capture output, warnings and exceptions, [`evaluate`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=evaluate) and [`callr`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=callr) can be used.

**Target Audience**

`r mlr_pkg("mlr3")` aims at users who have a minimum amount of exposure to ML and are at least somewhat fluent in R. 
It strives to be a powerful domain-specific language and workhorse for ML, instead of providing limited oneliner solutions for read-eval-print loop (REPL) operations. 
It is meant for programming, extension and expressive workflows.
While we try to make important operations as convenient as possible and try to be precise and helpful in our documentation, we will not hide certain technical underpinnings of the system from the user, e.g., our usage of _R6_, _data.table_ and _future_.
We expect users to familiarize themselves with these (great) packages.
