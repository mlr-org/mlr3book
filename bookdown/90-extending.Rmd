# Extending mlr3 {#extending-mlr3}

## Learners {#ext-learner}

Here, we show how to create a custom `r ref("LearnerClassif")` step-by-step.

Preferably, you start by copying over code from an existing `r ref("Learner")`, e.g. from the `"classif.rpart` learner on [GitHub](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3/blob/master/R/LearnerClassifRpart.R).
Alternatively, here is a template for a new classification learner:

```{r 90-extending-1, eval = FALSE}
LearnerClassifYourLearner = R6::R6Class("LearnerClassifYourLearner",
  inherit = LearnerClassif,
  public = list(
    initialize = function(id = "classif.yourlearner") {
      super$initialize(
        id = id,
        param_set = ParamSet$new(),
        param_vals = list()
        predict_types = ,
        feature_types = ,
        properties = ,
        packages = ,
      )
    },

    train = function(task) {

    },
    predict = function(task) {

    }
  )
)
```

In the first line of the template, we create a new `r cran_pkg("R6")` class with class `"LearnerClassifYourLearner"`.
The next line determines the parent class: As we want to create a classification learner, we obviously want to inherit from `r ref("LearnerClassif")`.

A learner consists of three parts:

1. [Meta information](#learner-meta-information) about the learners
2. A [`train()` function](#learner-train) which takes a `r ref("TaskClassif")`, fits a model, stores the model in `self$model` and returns the learner itself.
3. A [`predict()` function](#learner-predict) which operates on the stored model in `self$model` stored during `train()` and a (differently subsetted) `r ref("TaskClassif")` to calculate predictions for each observation in the provided task.

### Meta-information {#learner-meta-information}

In the constructor function `initialize()` the constructor of the super class `r ref("LearnerClassif")` is called with meta information about the leaner we want to construct.
This includes:

* `id`: The id of the new learner.
* `param_set`: A set of hyperparameters and their description, provided as `r ref("paradox::ParamSet")`.
* `param_vals`: Default hyperparameter settings as named list.
* `predict_types`: Set of predict types the learner is capable of.
  For classification, this must be a subset of `r mlr3misc::str_collapse(mlr_reflections$learner_predict_types$classif, quote = "\"")`.
  See `r ref("mlr_reflections", text = "mlr_reflection$learner_predict_types")` for possible predict types of other tasks.
* `feature_types`: Set of feature types the learner can handle.
  See `r ref("mlr_reflections", text = "mlr_reflections$task_feature_types")` for feature types supported by `mlr3`.
* `properties`: Set of properties of the learner. Possible properties include:
    * `"twoclass"`: The learner works on binary classification problems.
    * `"multiclass"`: The learner works on multi-class classification problems.
    * `"missings"`: The learner can natively handle missing values.
    * `"weights"`: The learner can work on tasks which have observation weights / case weights.
    * `"parallel"`: The learner can be parallelized, e.g. via threading.
    * `"importance"`: The learner supports extracting importance values for features. If this property is set, you must also implement a public method `importance()` to retrieve the importance values from the model.
    * `"selected features"`: The learner supports extracting the features which where used. If this property is set, you must also implement a public method `selected_features()` to retrieve the set of used features from the model.
* Set of required packages to run the learner.

For a simplified `r ref("rpart::rpart()")`, the initialization could look like this:

```{r 90-extending-2, eval = FALSE}
initialize = function(id = "classif.rpart") {
    super$initialize(
        id = id,
        packages = "rpart",
        feature_types = c("logical", "integer", "numeric", "factor"),
        predict_types = c("response", "prob"),
        param_set = ParamSet$new(
            params = list(
                ParamDbl$new(id = "cp", default = 0.01, lower = 0, upper = 1, tags = "train"),
                ParamInt$new(id = "xval", default = 0L, lower = 0L, tags = "train")
            )
        ),
        param_vals = list(xval = 0L),
        properties = c("twoclass", "multiclass", "weights", "missings")
    )
}
```

We only have specified a small subset of the available hyperparameters:

* The complexity `"cp"` is numeric, its feasible range is `[0,1]`, it defaults to `0.01` and the parameter is used during `"train"`.
* The complexity `"xval"` is integer, its lower bound `0`, its default is `0` and the parameter is also used during `"train"`. Note that we have changed the default here from `10` to `0` to save some computation time.
  This is **not** done by setting a different `default` in `ParamInt$new()`, but instead by setting the value implicitly via `param_vals`.

### Train function {#learner-train}

We continue the to adept the template for a `r ref("rpart::rpart()")` learner, and now tackle the `train()` function.
The train function takes a `r ref("Task")` as input and must return an arbitrary model.
First, we write something down that works completely without `mlr3`:

```{r 90-extending-3 }
data = iris
model = rpart::rpart(Species ~ ., data = iris, xval = 0)
```

In the next step, we replace the data frame `data` with a `r ref("Task")`:

```{r 90-extending-4 }
task = mlr_tasks$get("iris")
model = rpart::rpart(Species ~ ., data = task$data(), xval = 0)
```

The target variable `"Species"` is still hard-coded and specific to the task.
This is unnecessary, as the information about the target variable is stored in the task:

```{r 90-extending-5 }
task$target_names
task$formula()
```

We can adapt our code accordingly:

```{r 90-extending-6 }
model = rpart::rpart(task$formula(), data = task$data(), xval = 0)
```

The last thing missing is the handling of hyperparameters.
Instead of the hard-coded `xval`, we query the hyperparameter settings from the `r ref("Learner")` itself.

To illustrate this, we quickly construct the rpart learner from the `mlr3` package, and use the method `params()` to retrieve all actively set hyperparameters with tag `"train"`.

```{r 90-extending-7 }
self = mlr_learners$get("classif.rpart")
self$params("train")
```

To pass all hyperparameters returned by the `params()` method to the learner function, we recommend to use either `r ref("do.call")` or the function `r ref("mlr3misc::invoke()")`.

```{r 90-extending-8 }
pars = self$params("train")
model = mlr3misc::invoke(rpart::rpart, task$formula(),
    data = task$data(), .args = pars)
```

In the final learner, `self` will reference the learner itself.
In the last step, we wrap everything in a function.
The model is stored in the learner `self` and `self` is returned.

```{r 90-extending-9 }
train = function(task) {
    pars = self$params("train")
    self$model = mlr3misc::invoke(rpart::rpart, task$formula(),
        data = task$data(), .args = pars)
    self
}
```

### Predict function {#learner-predict}

The predict function also operates on a `r ref("Task")` as well as on the model stored during `train()`.
The return value must be a named list, where each list element corresponds to a predict type.

We proceed analogously to the section on the train function: We start with a version without any `mlr3` objects and continue to replace objects until we have reached the desired interface:

```{r 90-extending-10 }
# inputs:
task = mlr_tasks$get("iris")
self = list(model = rpart::rpart(task$formula(), data = task$data()))

data = iris
response = predict(self$model, newdata = data, type = "class")
prob = predict(self$model, newdata = data, type = "prob")
```

The `r ref("rpart::predict.rpart()")` function predicts class labels if argument `type` is set to to `"class"`, and class probabilities if set to `"prob"`.

Next, we transition from `data` to a `task` again.
Additionally, as we do not want to run the prediction twice, we differentiate what type of prediction is requested by querying the set predict type of the learner.

```{r 90-extending-11, eval = FALSE}
self$predict_type = "response"

if (self$predict_type == "response") {
  list(response = predict(self$model, newdata = task$data(), type = "class"))
} else {
  list(prob = predict(self$model, newdata = task$data(), type = "prob"))
}
```

The complete `predict()` function then looks like this:

```{r 90-extending-12, eval = FALSE}
predict = function(task) {
  if (self$predict_type == "response") {
    list(response = predict(self$model, newdata = task$data(), type = "class"))
  } else {
    list(prob = predict(self$model, newdata = task$data(), type = "prob"))
  }
}
```

Note that if the learner would need to handle hyperparameters during the predict step, we would proceed accordingly to the `train()` step and use `self$params("predict")` in combination with `r ref("mlr3misc::invoke()")`.

### Final learner

```{r 90-extending-13 }
LearnerClassifYourRpart = R6::R6Class("LearnerClassifYourRpart",
  inherit = LearnerClassif,
  public = list(
    initialize = function(id = "classif.rpart") {
      super$initialize(
        id = id,
        packages = "rpart",
        feature_types = c("logical", "integer", "numeric", "factor"),
        predict_types = c("response", "prob"),
        param_set = paradox::ParamSet$new(
          params = list(
            paradox::ParamDbl$new(id = "cp", default = 0.01, lower = 0, upper = 1, tags = "train"),
            paradox::ParamInt$new(id = "xval", default = 0L, lower = 0L, tags = "train")
          )
          ),
        param_vals = list(xval = 0L),
        properties = c("twoclass", "multiclass", "weights", "missings")
      )
    },

    train = function(task) {
      pars = self$params("train")
      self$model = mlr3misc::invoke(rpart::rpart, task$formula(),
        data = task$data(), .args = pars)
      self
    },

    predict = function(task) {
      if (self$predict_type == "response") {
        list(response = predict(self$model, newdata = task$data(), type = "class"))
      } else {
        list(prob = predict(self$model, data = newtask$data(), type = "prob"))
      }
    }
  )
)

lrn = LearnerClassifYourRpart$new()
print(lrn)
```

To run some basic tests:

```{r 90-extending-14 }
task = mlr_tasks$get("iris")
e = Experiment$new(task, lrn)$train()$predict()$score()
```

To run a bunch of automatic tests, you may source some auxiliary scripts from the unit tests of `mlr3`:

```{r 90-extending-15 }
helper = list.files(system.file("testthat", package = "mlr3"), pattern = "^helper.*\\.[rR]", full.names = TRUE)
ok = lapply(helper, source)
stopifnot(run_autotest(lrn))
```

## Tuners {#ext-tuner}

The exemplary tuner function in this tutorial is called `blackBoxFun`.

A new tuner consists of an **objective function** and settings.
The first one is the heart of the tuner.
It must fulfill the following requirements:

- Run the `r ref("mlr3tuning::PerformanceEvaluator")` for the parameter value `x`.
- Evaluate the `r ref("Learner")` using the given `r ref("Resampling")` object and add the `r ref("ResampleResult")` to the `r ref("BenchmarkResult")` object of the `r ref("mlr3tuning::PerformanceEvaluator")`.

### Objective function

A possible implementation could look as follows:

```{r 90-extending-16 }
blackBoxFun = function (x, pe) {
  x = mlr3misc::set_names(x, nm = pe$param_set$ids())
  pe$eval(x)
  performance = unlist(pe$bmr$data[.N]$performance)[[1]]
  if (! pe$task$measures[[1]]$minimize)
    return (-performance)
  return (performance)
}
```

With `pe` being the `r ref("mlr3tuning::PerformanceEvaluator")` object, `blackBoxFun()` should be able to do the following (similar to `r ref("mlr3tuning::TunerRandom")` or `r ref("mlr3tuning::TunerGenSA")`)

```{r 90-extending-17, eval = FALSE}
blackBoxFun(c(cp = 0.05), pe)
pe$bmr$aggregated()
```

### Tuner class

Now to actually call the optimizer using a dedicated R6 Tuner class, we add `blackBoxFun()` as a private method.
This can either be done for an existing class or a new R6 Tuner class can be created.

In this example we replace the private `.$tune_step()` method from `r ref("mlr3tuning::TunerGenSA")` with out new objective function that we defined above.

```{r 90-extending-18 }
TunerGenSA = R6Class("TunerGenSA",
  inherit = Tuner,
  public = list(
    GenSA_res = NULL,
    initialize = function(pe, evals, ...) {
      if (any(param_set$storage_type != "numeric")) {
        stop("Parameter types needs to be numeric")
      }
      checkmate::assert_integerish(evals, lower = 1L)
      super$initialize(id = "GenSA", pe = pe, terminator = TerminatorEvaluations$new(evals),
        settings = list(max.call = evals, ...))
    }
  ),
  private = list(
    tune_step = function() {
      blackBoxFun = function (x, pe) {
        x = mlr3misc::set_names(x, nm = pe$param_set$ids())
        pe$eval(x)
        performance = unlist(pe$bmr$data[.N]$performance)[[1]]
        if (! pe$task$measures[[1]]$minimize)
          return (-performance)
        return (performance)
      }
      self$GenSA_res = GenSA(fn = blackBoxFun, lower = self$pe$param_set$lower, upper = self$pe$param_set$upper,
        control = self$settings, pe = self$pe)
    }
  )
)
```

Note that the private method needs always be called `.$tune_step()` as it will be called from the `.$tune()` method of the `Tuner` class.

### Example

Now that the "new" `r ref("mlr3tuning::TunerGenSA")` tuner has been defined, we can test it in a small use case:

```{r 90-extending-19, error = T}
# does not work currently
task = mlr3::mlr_tasks$get("spam")
learner = mlr3::mlr_learners$get("classif.rpart")
learner$predict_type = "prob"
resampling = mlr3::mlr_resamplings$get("holdout")
measures = mlr3::mlr_measures$mget(c("classif.auc", "classif.ce"))
param_set = paradox::ParamSet$new(
  params = list(
    paradox::ParamDbl$new("cp", lower = 0.001, upper = 0.1)
  )
)

pe = PerformanceEvaluator$new(task, learner, resampling, param_set)
tuner = TunerGenSA$new(pe, 60L)
tuner$tune()

tuner$pe$bmr$aggregated()
tuner$tune_result()
str(tuner$GenSA_res)
```
