# Model Optimization {#model-optim}

**Model Tuning**

Machine learning algorithms have default values set for their hyperparameters.
Irrespective, these hyperparameters need to be changed by the user to achieve optimal performance on the given dataset.
A manual selection of hyperparameter values is not recommended as this approach rarely leads to an optimal performance.
To substantiate the validity of the selected hyperparameters (= [tuning](#tuning)), data-driven optimization is recommended.
In order to tune a machine learning algorithm, one has to specify (1) the [search space](#tuning-optimization), (2) the [optimization algorithm](#tuning-optimization) (aka tuning method) and (3) an evaluation method, i.e., a resampling strategy and a performance measure.

In summary, the sub-chapter on [tuning](#tuning) illustrates how to:

* undertake empirically sound [hyperparameter selection](#tuning)
* select the [optimizing algorithm](#tuning-optimization)
* [trigger](#tuning-triggering) the tuning
* [automate](#autotuner) tuning

This sub-chapter also requires the package `r mlr_pkg("mlr3tuning")`, an extension package which supports hyperparameter tuning.

**Feature Selection**

The second part of this chapter explains [feature selection](#fs).
The objective of [feature selection](#fs) is to fit the sparse dependent of a model on a subset of available data features in the most suitable manner.
[Feature selection](#fs) can enhance the interpretability of the model, speed up model fitting and improve the learner performance by reducing noise in the data.
Different approaches exist to identify the relevant features.
In the sub-chapter on [feature selection](#fs), three approaches are emphasized:

* Feature selection using [filter](#fs-filter) algorithms
* Feature selection via [variable importance filters](#fs-var-imp-filter)
* Feature selection by employing the so called [wrapper methods](#fs-wrapper)

A fourth approach, feature selection via [ensemble filters](#fs-ensemble), is introduced subsequently.
The implementation of all four approaches in mlr3 is showcased using the extension-package `mlr3filters`.

**Nested Resampling**

In order to get a good estimate of generalization performance and avoid data leakage, both an outer (performance) and an inner (tuning/feature selection) resampling process are necessary.
Following features are discussed in this chapter:

* [Inner and outer resampling strategies](#nested-resampling) in nested resampling
* The [execution](#nested-resamp-exec) of nested resampling
* The [evaluation](#nested-resamp-eval) of executed resampling iterations

This sub-section will provide instructions on how to implement nested resampling, accounting for both inner and outer resampling in `r mlr_pkg("mlr3")`.

## Hyperparameter Tuning {#tuning}

Hyperparameter tuning is supported via the extension package `r mlr_pkg("mlr3tuning")`.
Below you can find an illustration of the process:

```{r 03-optimization-001, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/tuning_process.svg")
```

The heart of `r mlr_pkg("mlr3tuning")` are the R6 classes:

* `r ref("TuningInstance")`: This class describes the tuning problem and stores results.
* `r ref("Tuner")`: This class is the base class for implementations of tuning algorithms.

### The `TuningInstance` Class {#tuning-optimization}

The following sub-section examines the optimization of a simple classification tree on the `r ref("mlr_tasks_pima", text = "Pima Indian Diabetes")` data set.

```{r 03-optimization-002}
task = tsk("pima")
print(task)
```

We use the classification tree from `r cran_pkg("rpart")` and choose a subset of the hyperparameters we want to tune.
This is often referred to as the "tuning space".

```{r 03-optimization-003}
learner = lrn("classif.rpart")
learner$param_set
```

Here, we opt to tune two parameters:

* The complexity `cp`
* The termination criterion `minsplit`

The tuning space has to be bound, therefore one has to set lower and upper bounds:

```{r 03-optimization-004}
library(paradox)
tune_ps = ParamSet$new(list(
  ParamDbl$new("cp", lower = 0.001, upper = 0.1),
  ParamInt$new("minsplit", lower = 1, upper = 10)
))
tune_ps
```

Next, we need to specify how to evaluate the performance.
For this, we need to choose a `r ref("Resampling", text = "resampling strategy")` and a `r ref("Measure", text = "performance measure")`.

```{r 03-optimization-005}
hout = rsmp("holdout")
measure = msr("classif.ce")
```

Finally, one has to select the budget available, to solve this tuning instance.
This is done by selecting one of the available `r ref("Terminator", text = "Terminators")`:

* Terminate after a given time (`r ref("TerminatorClockTime")`)
* Terminate after a given amount of iterations (`r ref("TerminatorEvals")`)
* Terminate after a specific performance is reached (`r ref("TerminatorPerfReached")`)
* Terminate when tuning does not improve (`r ref("TerminatorStagnation")`)
* A combination of the above in an *ALL* or *ANY* fashion, using `r ref("TerminatorCombo")`

For this short introduction, we grant a budget of 20 evaluations and then put everything together into a `r ref("TuningInstance")`:

```{r 03-optimization-006}
library(mlr3tuning)

evals20 = term("evals", n_evals = 20)

instance = TuningInstance$new(
  task = task,
  learner = learner,
  resampling = hout,
  measures = measure,
  param_set = tune_ps,
  terminator = evals20
)
print(instance)
```

To start the tuning, we still need to select how the optimization should take place.
In other words, we need to choose the **optimization algorithm** via the `r ref("Tuner")` class.

### The `Tuner` Class

The following algorithms are currently implemented in `r mlr_pkg("mlr3tuning")`:

* Grid Search (`r ref("TunerGridSearch")`)
* Random Search (`r ref("TunerRandomSearch")`) [@bergstra2012]
* Generalized Simulated Annealing (`r ref("TunerGenSA")`)

In this example, we will use a simple grid search with a grid resolution of 10:

```{r 03-optimization-007}
tuner = tnr("grid_search", resolution = 5)
```

Since we have only numeric parameters, `r ref("TunerGridSearch")` will create a grid of equally-sized steps between the respective upper and lower bounds.
As we have two hyperparameters with a resolution of 5, the two-dimensional grid consists of $5^2 = 25$ configurations.
Each configuration serves as hyperparameter setting for the classification tree and triggers a 3-fold cross validation on the task.
All configurations will be examined by the tuner (in a random order), until either all configurations are evaluated or the `r ref("Terminator")` signals that the budget is exhausted.

### Triggering the Tuning {#tuning-triggering}

To start the tuning, we simply pass the `r ref("TuningInstance")` to the `$tune()` method of the initialized `r ref("Tuner")`.
The tuner proceeds as follow:

1. The `r ref("Tuner")` proposes at least one hyperparameter configuration (the `r ref("Tuner")` and may propose multiple points to improve parallelization, which can be controlled via the setting `batch_size`).
2. For each configuration, a `r ref("Learner")` is fitted on `r ref("Task")` using the provided `r ref("Resampling")`.
   The results are combined with other results from previous iterations to a single `r ref("BenchmarkResult")`.
3. The `r ref("Terminator")` is queried if the budget is exhausted.
   If the budget is not exhausted, restart with 1) until it is.
4. Determine the configuration with the best observed performance.
5. Return a named list with the hyperparameter settings (`"values"`) and the corresponding measured performance (`"performance"`).

```{r 03-optimization-008}
result = tuner$tune(instance)
print(result)
```

One can investigate all resamplings which where undertaken, using the `$archive()` method of the `r ref("TuningInstance")`.
Here, we just extract the performance values and the hyperparameters:

```{r 03-optimization-009}
instance$archive(unnest = "params")[, c("cp", "minsplit", "classif.ce")]
```

In sum, the grid search evaluated 20/25 different configurations of the grid in a random order before the `r ref("Terminator")` stopped the tuning.

Now the optimized hyperparameters can take the previously created `r ref("Learner")`, set the returned hyperparameters and train it on the full dataset.

```{r 03-optimization-010}
learner$param_set$values = instance$result$params
learner$train(task)
```

The trained model can now be used to make a prediction on external data.
Note that predicting on observations present in the `task`,  should be avoided.
The model has seen these observations already during tuning and therefore results would be statistically biased.
Hence, the resulting performance measure would be over-optimistic.
Instead, to get statistically unbiased performance estimates for the current task, [nested resampling](#nested-resamling) is required.

### Automating the Tuning {#autotuner}

The `r ref("AutoTuner")` wraps a learner and augments it with an automatic tuning for a given set of hyperparameters.
Because the `r ref("AutoTuner")` itself inherits from the `r ref("Learner")` base class, it can be used like any other learner.
Analogously to the previous subsection, a new classification tree learner is created.
This classification tree learner automatically tunes the parameters `cp` and `minsplit` using an inner resampling (holdout).
We create a terminator which allows 10 evaluations, and use a simple random search as tuning algorithm:

```{r 03-optimization-011}
library(paradox)
library(mlr3tuning)

learner = lrn("classif.rpart")
resampling = rsmp("holdout")
measures = msr("classif.ce")
tune_ps = ParamSet$new(list(
  ParamDbl$new("cp", lower = 0.001, upper = 0.1),
  ParamInt$new("minsplit", lower = 1, upper = 10)
))
terminator = term("evals", n_evals = 10)
tuner = tnr("random_search")

at = AutoTuner$new(
  learner = learner,
  resampling = resampling,
  measures = measures,
  tune_ps = tune_ps,
  terminator = terminator,
  tuner = tuner
)
at
```

We can now use the learner like any other learner, calling the `$train()` and `$predict()` method.
This time however, we pass it to `r ref("benchmark()")` to compare the tuner to a classification tree without tuning.
This way, the `r ref("AutoTuner")` will do its resampling for tuning on the training set of the respective split of the outer resampling.
The learner then undertakes predictions using the test set of the outer resampling.
This yields unbiased performance measures, as the observations in the test set have not been used during tuning or fitting of the respective learner.
This is called [nested resampling](#nested-resampling).

To compare the tuned learner with the learner using its default, we can use `r ref("benchmark()")`:

```{r 03-optimization-012}
grid = benchmark_grid(
  task = tsk("pima"),
  learner = list(at, lrn("classif.rpart")),
  resampling = rsmp("cv", folds = 3)
)
bmr = benchmark(grid)
bmr$aggregate(measures)
```

Note that we do not expect any differences compared to the non-tuned approach for multiple reasons:

* the task is too easy
* the task is rather small, and thus prone to overfitting
* the tuning budget (10 evaluations) is small
* `r cran_pkg("rpart")` does not benefit that much from tuning


## Feature Selection / Filtering {#fs}

Often, data sets include a large number of features.
The technique of extracting a subset of relevant features is called "feature selection".

The objective of feature selection is to fit the sparse dependent of a model on a subset of available data features in the most suitable manner.
Feature selection can enhance the interpretability of the model, speed up the learning process and improve the learner performance.
Different approaches exist to identify the relevant features.
Two different approaches are emphasized in the literature:
One is called [Filtering](#fs-filtering) and the other approach is often referred to as feature subset selection or [wrapper methods](#fs-wrapper).

What are the differences [@chandrashekar2014]?

* **Filtering**: An external algorithm computes a rank of the variables (e.g. based on the correlation to the response).
  Then, features are subsetted by a certain criteria, e.g. an absolute number or a percentage of the number of variables.
  The selected features will then be used to fit a model (with optional hyperparameters selected by tuning).
  This calculation is usually cheaper than “feature subset selection” in terms of computation time.
* **Wrapper Methods**: Here, no ranking of features is done.
  Features are selected by a (random) subset of the data.
  Then, we fit a model and subsequently assess the performance.
  This is done for a lot of feature combinations in a cross-validation (CV) setting and the best combination is reported.
  This method is very computational intense as a lot of models are fitted.
  Also, strictly speaking all these models would need to be tuned before the performance is estimated.
  This would require an additional nested level in a CV setting.
  After undertaken all of these steps, the selected subset of features is again fitted (with optional hyperparameters selected by tuning).

There is also a third approach which can be attributed to the "filter" family:
The embedded feature-selection methods of some `r ref("Learner")`.
Read more about how to use these in section [embedded feature-selection methods](#fs-embedded).

[Ensemble filters]({#fs-ensemble}) built upon the idea of stacking single filter methods.
These are not yet implemented.

All functionality that is related to feature selection is implemented via the extension package `r gh_pkg("mlr-org/mlr3filters")`.

### Filters {#fs-filter}

Filter methods assign an importance value to each feature.
Based on these values the features can be ranked.
Thereafter, we are able to select a feature subset.
There is a list of all implemented filter methods in the [Appendix](#list-filters).

### Calculating filter values {#fs-calc}

Currently, only classification and regression tasks are supported.

The first step it to create a new R object using the class of the desired filter method.
Each object of class `Filter` has a `.$calculate()` method which calculates the filter values and ranks them in a descending order.

```{r 03-optimization-013}
library(mlr3filters)
filter = FilterJMIM$new()

task = tsk("iris")
filter$calculate(task)

as.data.table(filter)
```

Some filters support changing specific hyperparameters.
This is done similar to setting hyperparameters of a `r ref("Learner")` using `.$param_set$values`:

```{r 03-optimization-014}
filter_cor = FilterCorrelation$new()
filter_cor$param_set

# change parameter 'method'
filter_cor$param_set$values = list(method = "spearman")
filter_cor$param_set
```

Rather than taking the "long" R6 way to create a filter, there is also a built-in shorthand notation for filter creation:

```{r 03-optimization-015}
filter = flt("cmim")
filter
```

### Variable Importance Filters {#fs-var-imp-filters}

All `r ref("Learner")` with the property "importance" come with integrated feature selection methods.

You can find a list of all learners with this property in the [Appendix](#fs-filter-embedded-list).

For some learners the desired filter method needs to be set during learner creation.
For example, learner `classif.ranger` (in the package `r mlr_pkg("mlr3learners")`) comes with multiple integrated methods.
See the help page of `r ref("ranger::ranger")`.
To use method "impurity", you need to set the filter method during construction.

```{r 03-optimization-016}
library(mlr3learners)
lrn = lrn("classif.ranger", importance = "impurity")
```

Now you can use the `r ref("mlr3filters::FilterImportance")` class for algorithm-embedded methods to filter a `r ref("Task")`.

```{r 03-optimization-017}
library(mlr3learners)

task = tsk("iris")
filter = flt("importance", learner = lrn)
filter$calculate(task)
head(as.data.table(filter), 3)
```

### Ensemble Methods {#fs-ensemble}

```{block, type='warning'}
Work in progress :)
```

### Wrapper Methods {#fs-wrapper}

```{block, type='warning'}
Work in progress :) - via package _mlr3fswrap_
```

## Nested Resampling {#nested-resampling}

In order to obtain unbiased performance estimates for learners, all parts of the model building (preprocessing and model selection steps) should be included in the resampling, i.e., repeated for every pair of training/test data.
For steps that themselves require resampling like hyperparameter tuning or feature-selection (via the wrapper approach) this results in two nested resampling loops.

```{r 03-optimization-018, echo = FALSE, out.width="98%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/nested_resampling.png")
```

The graphic above illustrates nested resampling for parameter tuning with 3-fold cross-validation in the outer and 4-fold cross-validation in the inner loop.

In the outer resampling loop, we have three pairs of training/test sets.
On each of these outer training sets parameter tuning is done, thereby executing the inner resampling loop.
This way, we get one set of selected hyperparameters for each outer training set.
Then the learner is fitted on each outer training set using the corresponding selected hyperparameters.
Following, we can evaluate the performance of the learner on the outer test sets.

In `r gh_pkg("mlr-org/mlr3")`, you can get nested resampling for free without programming any looping by using the `r ref("mlr3tuning::AutoTuner")` class.
This works as follows:

1. Generate a wrapped Learner via class `r ref("mlr3tuning::AutoTuner")` or `mlr3filters::AutoSelect` (not yet implemented).
2. Specify all required settings - see section ["Automating the Tuning"](#autotuner) for help.
3. Call function `r ref("resample()")` or `r ref("benchmark()")` with the created `r ref("Learner")`.

You can freely combine different inner and outer resampling strategies.

A common setup is prediction and performance evaluation on a fixed outer test set. This can be achieved by passing the `r ref("Resampling")` strategy (`rsmp("holdout")`) as the outer resampling instance to either `r ref("resample()")` or `r ref("benchmark()")`.

The inner resampling strategy could be a cross-validation one (`rsmp("cv")`) as the sizes of the outer training sets might differ.
Per default, the inner resample description is instantiated once for every outer training set.

Note that nested resampling is computationally expensive.
For this reason we use relatively small search spaces and a low number of resampling iterations in the examples shown below.
In practice, you normally have to increase both.
As this is computationally intensive you might want to have a look at the section on [Parallelization](#parallelization).

### Execution {#nested-resamp-exec}

To optimize hyperparameters or conduct feature selection in a nested resampling you need to create learners using either:

* the `r ref("AutoTuner")` class, or
* the `mlr3filters::AutoSelect` class (not yet implemented)

We use the example from section ["Automating the Tuning"](#autotuner) and pipe the resulting learner into a `r ref("resample()")` call.

```{r 03-optimization-019}
library(mlr3tuning)
task = tsk("iris")
learner = lrn("classif.rpart")
resampling = rsmp("holdout")
measures = msr("classif.ce")
param_set = paradox::ParamSet$new(
  params = list(paradox::ParamDbl$new("cp", lower = 0.001, upper = 0.1)))
terminator = term("evals", n_evals = 5)
tuner = tnr("grid_search", resolution = 10)

at = AutoTuner$new(learner, resampling, measures = measures,
  param_set, terminator, tuner = tuner)
```

Now construct the `r ref("resample()")` call:

```{r 03-optimization-020}
resampling_outer = rsmp("cv", folds = 3)
rr = resample(task = task, learner = at, resampling = resampling_outer)
```

### Evaluation {#nested-resamp-eval}

With the created `r ref("ResampleResult")` we can now inspect the executed resampling iterations more closely.
See the section on [Resampling](#resampling) for more detailed information about `r ref("ResampleResult")` objects.

For example, we can query the aggregated performance result:

```{r 03-optimization-021}
rr$aggregate()
```

<!-- We can also query the tuning result of any learner using the `$tune_path` field of the `r ref("AutoTuner")` class stored in the `r ref("ResampleResult")` container `rr`. -->

<!-- ```{block, type="caution"} -->
<!-- Note: This only works if `store_bmr` was set to `TRUE` in the `AutoTuner` object. -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ```{r 02-nested-resamp-005, eval = FALSE} -->
<!-- # FIXME: not yet done -->
<!-- rr$learners[[1]]$tune_path -->
<!-- ``` -->

Check for any errors in the folds during execution (if there is not output, warnings or errors recorded, this is an empty `data.table()`:

```{r 03-optimization-022}
rr$errors
```

Or take a look at the confusion matrix of the joined predictions:

```{r 03-optimization-023}
rr$prediction()$confusion
```
