# Model Interpretation {#interpretation}

In principle, all generic frameworks for model interpretation are applicable on the models fitted with `mlr3` by just extracting the fitted models from the `"Learner")` objects.

However, two of the most popular frameworks,

* `r mlr3book::cran_pkg("iml")` in Subsection \@ref(iml),
* `r mlr3book::cran_pkg("DALEX")` in Subsection \@ref(dalex), and

additionally come with some convenience for `mlr3`.
