# Technical {#technical}

This chapter gives an overview about technical details of the `r mlr_pkg("mlr3")` framework.

**Parallelization**

At first, some details about [Parallelization](#parallelization) and the usage of the `r cran_pkg("future")` are given.
Parallelization refers to the process of running multiple jobs simultaneously.
This process is employed to minimize the necessary computing power.
Algorithms consist of both sequential (non-parallelizable) and paralizable parts. 
Therefore, parallelization does not always alter performance in a positive substantial manner.
Summed up, this sub-chapter illustrates how and when to use parallelization in mlr3.

**Database Backends**

The Section [Database Backends](#backends) describes how to work with database backends that `r mlr_pkg("mlr3")` supports.
Database backends can be helpful for large data processing which does not fit in memory or is stored natively in a database (e.g. sqlite).
Specifically when working with large data sets or when undertaking numerous tasks simultaneously, it can be advantageous to interface out-of-memory data.
The section provides an illustration of how to implement [Database Backends](#backends) using of NYC flight data. 

**Parameters**

In the section [Parameters](#paradox) instructions are given on how to:

* Define parameter sets for learners
* Undertake parameter sampling
* Apply parameter transformations

For illustrative purposes, this sub-chapter uses the package `paradox`, the successor of the package `ParamHelpers`.

**Logging and Verbosity**

The sub-chapter on [Logging and Verbosity](#logging) shows how to change the most important settings related to logging.
For this sub-chapter we use the package _lgr_.

**Transition Guide**

Lastly, we provide a [Transition Guide](#transition) for users of the old `r mlr_pkg("mlr")` who want to switch to `r mlr_pkg("mlr3")`.
