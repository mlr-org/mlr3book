# Technical {#technical}

This chapter gives an overview about technical details of the `r mlr_pkg("mlr3")` framework.

At first, some details about parallelization and the usage of the `r cran_pkg("future")` are given.

Section [Database Backends](#backends) describes how to work with database backends that `r mlr_pkg("mlr3")` supports.
Database backends can be helpful for large data processing which does not fit in memory or is stored natively in a database (e.g. sqlite).

In section [Parameters](#paradox) instructions are given how to define parameter sets for learners, how do sample parameters and apply parameter transformations.

Last, we provide a transition guide for users of the old `r mlr_pkg("mlr")` who want to switch to `r mlr_pkg("mlr3")`.
