# Introduction {#introduction}

A typical machine-learning workflow looks like this:

```{r 02-building-blocks-1, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ml_abstraction.png")
```

We refer to "building blocks" in our guide as steps in the machine-learning workflow.
The ones shown above are the essential blocks.
Other building blocks can be added to the workflow to enhance certain parts of the essential blocks.

The `mlr3` package provides R6 class objects for the _building blocks_ [tasks](#tasks), [learners](#learners) and [measures](#measures).

Other _building blocks_ include:

- Ensemble learners (stacking of models)
- Feature selection
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Parallelization 
- Preprocessing of data
- Resampling methods

These additional blocks are provided by our extension packages such as `r gh_pkg("mlr-org/mlr3tuning")`, `r gh_pkg("mlr-org/mlr3pipelines")` or `r gh_pkg("mlr-org/mlr3featuresel")`.ing.

## Equivalent elements from `mlr`

In case you have already worked with `mlr`, you may want quickstart with `mlr3` by looking up the specific equivalent of an element of `mlr` in the new version `mlr3`.
For this, you can use the following table.
This table is not complete but should give you an overview about how `mlr3` is organized.

```{r introduction-mlr-table, echo = FALSE}
tmlr = c(
  "`RegrTask` / `ClassifTask`",
  "`SurvTask`",
  "`ClusterTask`",
  "`MultilabelTask` / `CostSensTask`",
  gh_pkg("berndbischl/ParamHelpers"),
  "`makeNumericParam()` / `makeIntegerParam()` / `makeDiscreteParam()` / `makeLogicalParam()` from ParamHelpers",
  "`makeLearner()`",
  "`train()` / `predict()`",
  "`listMeasures()` / `performance()`",
  "`makeResampleDesc()`",
  "`resample()` / `benchmark()`",
  paste0("Parallelization using ", cran_pkg("parallelMap")),
  "manual visualization via ggplot2/ggvis")
tmlr3 = c(
  "`TaskRegr` / `TaskClassif`",
  paste0("`TaskSurv` from ", gh_pkg('mlr-org/mlr3survival')),
  "Not yet implemented",
  "???",
  gh_pkg("mlr-org/paradox"),
  "`ParamDbl$new()` / `ParamInt$new()` / `ParamFct$new()` / `ParamLgl$new()` from paradox",
  "`mlr_learners$get()`",
  "`Experiment$train()` / `Experiment$predict()`",
  "`task$measures` / `Experiment$score()`",
  "`mlr_resamplings$get()`",
  "`resample()` / `benchmark()`",
  paste0("Parallelization using ", cran_pkg("future")),
  gh_pkg("mlr-org/mlr3viz"))
knitr::kable(x = data.frame(tmlr, tmlr3), col.names = c("Element of mlr", "Equivalent in mlr3"))
```
