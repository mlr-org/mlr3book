# Introduction {#introduction}

A typical machine-learning workflow looks like this:

```{r 01-introduction-001, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ml_abstraction.png")
```

We refer to "building blocks" in our guide as steps in the machine-learning workflow.
The ones shown above are the essential blocks.
Other building blocks can be added to the workflow to enhance certain parts of the essential blocks.

The `mlr3` package provides R6 class objects for the _building blocks_ [tasks](#tasks), [learners](#learners) and [measures](#measures).

Other _building blocks_ include:

- Ensemble learners (stacking of models)
- Feature selection
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Parallelization 
- Preprocessing of data
- Resampling methods

These additional blocks are provided by our extension packages such as `r gh_pkg("mlr-org/mlr3tuning")`, `r gh_pkg("mlr-org/mlr3pipelines")` or `r gh_pkg("mlr-org/mlr3featuresel")`.ing.
