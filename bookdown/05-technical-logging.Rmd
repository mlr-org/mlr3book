### Logging {#logging}

_lgr_ comes with a global option called `"lgr.default_threshold"` which can be set via `options()`.
You can set a specific level in your `.Rprofile` which is then used for all packages that use the _lgr_ package.
This approach may not be desirable if you want to only change the logging level for `r mlr_pkg("mlr3")`.

### Changing mlr3 logging levels

To change the setting for `r mlr_pkg("mlr3")` only, you need to change the threshold of the `r mlr_pkg("mlr3")` logger like this:

```{r 05-technical-logging-001, eval = FALSE}
lgr::get_logger("mlr3")$set_threshold("<level>")
```

Remember that this change only applies to the current R session.
