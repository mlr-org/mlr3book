# Special Tasks {#special-tasks}

This chapter explores the different functions of `mlr3` when dealing with specific data sets that require further statistical modification to undertake sensible analysis.
Following topics are discussed:

**Survival Analysis**

This sub-chapter explains how to conduct sound [survival analysis](#survival) in mlr3.
[Survival analysis](#survival) is used to monitor the period of time until a specific event takes places.
This specific event could be e.g. death, transmission of a disease, marriage or divorce.
Two considerations are important when conducting [survival analysis](#survival):

* Whether the event occurred within the frame of the given data
* How much time it took until the event occurred

In summary, this sub-chapter explains how to account for these considerations and conduct survival analysis using the `mlr3proba` extension package.

**Density Estimation**

This sub-chapter explains how to conduct (unconditional) [density estimation](#density) in mlr3.
[Density estimation](#density) is used to estimate the probability density function of a continuous variable. Unconditional density estimation is an unsupervised task so there is no 'value' to predict, instead densities are *estimated*.

This sub-chapter explains how to estimate probability distributions for continuous variables using the `mlr3proba` extension package.

**Spatial Analysis**

[Spatial analysis](#spatial) data observations entail reference information about spatial characteristics.
One of the largest shortcomings of [spatial data analysis](#spatial) is the inevitable auto-correlation in spatial data.
Auto-correlation is especially severe in data with marginal spatial variation.
The sub-chapter on [spatial analysis](#spatial) provides instructions on how to handle the problems associated with spatial data accordingly.

**Ordinal Analysis**

This is work in progress.
See `r gh_pkg("mlr-org/mlr3ordinal")` for the current state.

**Functional Analysis**

[Functional analysis](#functional) contains data that consists of curves varying over a continuum e.g. time, frequency or wavelength.
This type of analysis is frequently used when examining measurements over various time points.
Steps on how to accommodate functional data structures in mlr3 are explained in the [functional analysis](#functional) sub-chapter.

**Multilabel Classification**

[Multilabel classification](#multilabel) deals with objects that can belong to more than one category at the same time.
Numerous target labels are attributed to a single observation.
Working with multilabel data requires one to use modified algorithms, to accommodate data specific characteristics.
Two approaches to [multilabel classification](#multilabel) are prominently used:

* The problem transformation method
* The algorithm adaption method

Instructions on how to deal with [multilabel classification](#multilabel) in mlr3 can be found in this sub-chapter.

**Cost Sensitive Classification**

This sub-chapter deals with the implementation of [cost-sensitive classification](#cost-sens).
Regular classification aims to minimize the misclassification rate and thus all types of misclassification errors are deemed equally severe.
[Cost-sensitive classification](#cost-sens) is a setting where the costs caused by different kinds of errors are not assumed to be equal.
The objective is to minimize the expected costs.

Analytical data for a big credit institution is used as a use case to illustrate the different features.
Firstly, the sub-chapter provides guidance on how to implement a first model.
Subsequently, the sub-chapter contains instructions on how to modify cost sensitivity measures, thresholding and threshold tuning.
